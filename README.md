# EFT Finder

EFT Finder is a Discord bot designed specifically for Escape From Tarkov players.

For the purpose of using EFT Finder, you should first join the EFT Finder Discord server (https://discord.gg/mdhskdh).

You will find the following instructions in the #welcome channel:

This experiment is designed to allow you to find others in your current raid. It is up to you what you do with this tool, however, cooperation is strongly encouraged. Some ideas might include: Scav + PMC extract locations, raider / boss farming, tasks, coordinated PvP, it's truly up to you.

To get started: 

• Join the voice channel titled "Lobby - Start Here!" 
• And/Or Type " .join '<serverCode> " into #server-codes 

e.g.  ".join Y3AH"

This will generate a voice channel for you with appropriate permissions. If you are connected to the Lobby channel when you send this command, you will be moved automatically. Otherwise, just hop right in. If others in your server have entered the same code, they should be able to see and join your channel. 

The lobby is kept quiet for your convenience.
